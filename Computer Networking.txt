TCP - Transmission Control Protocol
------------------------------------
It ensures that data will reach the correct destination without being corrupted on the way
To receive completely TCP is used


UDP - User Datagram Protocol
-----------------------------
Maybe 100% data will not be reached, some may be lost
Video conferencing


HTTP - Hyper Text Transfer Protocol
------------------------------------
Used by World Wide Web(WWW)/web browsers
Defines the format of the data that is being transfered by web clients



$curl ifconfig.me -s  //to get the ip address of the internet provider
---------------------


DHCP - Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (assigns IP address connected to MODEM)

NAT - Network Access Translator (helps to determine which device requested the service)


IP address determine where your computer are located (computer or server pointed to {like a number of a person})
eg: www.goolge.com -> x.x.x.x(ip address)
Port number determine which application you are using to communicate (application)


---------------------------------------------------------------
ports are 16 bit numbers
so,maximum available port numbers = 2 to the power 16 = 65,536

HTTP = 80  //port number
mongoDB = 27017
SQL = 1433
Telnet = 23
pop = 110

ports from 0 - 1023 are reserved ports
ports from 1024 - 49152 are registered for some specific applications
Remaining - you can use

----------------------------------------------------------------
1 mbps = 10,00,000 bits/s (6 zeros)
1 gbps = 1,00,00,00,000 bits/s (9 zeros)
1 kbps = 1000 bits/s (3 zeros)
----------------------------------------------------------------

ping google.com  //to see packets transmitted
(ping - measures the round trip time for messages send from the originating host to the destination of the computer and that are a cord back)
ping time  //can't be reduced cause we are getting the best possible ping time, signals are travelling at the speed of light
           //through cables, satellites, etc. so we are getting the best possible time



nslookup -type=mx gmail.com  //to get the name and ip address of SMTP servers for various domains
nslookup - name server lookup
-type=mx - mail exchange (Basically means SMTP servers) and for gmail.com


dig google.com  //DNS lookup utility (Domain information gropper){One that i stored in my local cache}
man dig


sudo tcpdump -c 5  //to see all the data packets that are coming in and out of your computer
-c 5 - to give only 5 packets
if -c 5 is removed then it will show you all the data coming
